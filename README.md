## Dice Game

This is a simple dice game implemented in Python, where 2 to 4 players compete to reach a maximum score of 50. Players take turns to roll a die, and their scores accumulate unless they roll a 1, which ends their turn and resets their score for that turn.

### Usage
<ul>
<li> Run the script. </li>
<li>Enter the number of players (between 2 and 4).</li>
<li>Players take turns rolling the die by typing y to roll or any other key to end their turn.</li>
<li>The game ends when a player reaches the maximum score of 50, and the winner is announced.</li>
</ul>
